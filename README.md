## Overview

Autonomous Delivery Robot with Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance is a ROS-based indoor robot designed to automate goods delivery in places like offices, malls, and hospitals. It navigates autonomously using LiDAR and the ROS Navigation Stack, avoids static and dynamic obstacles, and delivers items securely using QR code-based authentication.

Built with a 3D-printed chassis and powered by Jetson Nano, the robot includes dual delivery compartments, a live camera feed, and multiple control modesâ€”manual (teleop), scripted, and fully autonomous. Mapping and localization are handled via Cartographer SLAM, and the full system was tested in Gazebo and RViz before real-world deployment.
