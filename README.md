## Overview

This projects aimed to develop a robot to be operated autonomously for indoor environments. Some use cases for the robot are as a hospital helpler robot or a office robot. 

The complete robot was designed and 3D printed from scratch at the BVM College, Vallabhvidhyanagar, India by me and my team.

The robot has compartments in which items can be stored and locked using the servo motor for secure delivery purpose. The robot containes a LIDAR sensor for navigation, ultrasonic sensor for small obstacle detection and camera for QR-code detection. It is battery-operated and rechargable.
